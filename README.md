# FloraScan-Plant-Disease-Diagnosis
FloraScan is a web-based plant disease detection system that uses a CNN model to identify diseases from uploaded plant leaf images. The model is trained using a public dataset in Google Colab and integrated into a Flask web application, allowing users to easily upload images and receive disease predictions.


Problem Statement

Plant diseases often remain undetected until they cause serious damage which results in reduced crop yield and economic loss. There is a need for a simple and accessible system that can assist in early detection of plant diseases using image based analysis.

Objective

To detect plant diseases using leaf images  
To apply CNN for image classification  
To build a user friendly web application using Flask  
To provide disease prediction without real time camera usage  

Features

Image upload for plant leaves  
CNN based disease prediction  
Flask backend integration  
Simple and easy to use interface  
Does not require real time camera input  

Tech Stack

Python  
TensorFlow and Keras  
Flask  
HTML CSS and Bootstrap  
Google Colab for model training  

Project Workflow

User uploads a plant leaf image  
The image is preprocessed  
The CNN model predicts the disease  
The result is displayed on the web page
